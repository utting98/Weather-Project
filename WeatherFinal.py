Weather Widget

Gets your ip address and uses it to work out an approximate location then gives you the
weather in that location all in a GUI window. Also option to search a city in a Country
and display the weather of the city you have entered. This code relies on geocoder for
location data and openweathermap for weather data. Error handling is in place for attempting
to use without internet connection, attempting to get weather more than once without clearing
or attempting to clear already destroyed canvases and entering an invalid city country combo
for the manual location entry method.

This program relies on prior install of gecoder by [pip install geocoder]
